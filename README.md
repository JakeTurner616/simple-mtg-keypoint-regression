# Simple MTG Keypoint Regression â€“ Dataset + Model Training Pipeline

[View the full model training notebook on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jaketurner616/mtg-keypoint-regression-heatmap) Or run the project locally.

This project generates synthetic training data using MTG artwork, applies controlled distortions, and trains a TensorFlow-based corner regression model. The final model is exported to TensorFlow.js for real-time MTG ROI extraction on the web.

## Overview

### 1. Dataset Generation (`dataset.py`)

* **Downloads card images** by performing a set amount of 'cycles' to add equally diverse border styles.
* **Applies perspective & affine transforms** to simulate real-world camera angle perspective shifts
* **Composites each card** onto random photographic and texture backgrounds
* **Annotates true corner positions** of the distorted card in the output image

Each synthetic image is saved as a `.jpg`, and its 4 corner positions are recorded in `annotations.json`.

### Output format:

```json
{
  "filename": "00042_Llanowar_Elves.jpg",
  "card_name": "Llanowar Elves",
  "corners": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}
```

> Images are 1024Ã—1024 with randomized placement, scale, and angle. All data is stored locally and can be extended with new backgrounds or distortion rules.

---

### 2. Model Training (`mtg-keypoint-regression-heatmap.ipynb`)

* Loads the dataset and builds a dual-output model:

  * `heatmaps`: 4 heatmap channels (one per corner)
  * `coords`: predicted coordinates via soft-argmax
* Based on a pretrained ResNet-50 backbone (ImageNet weights)
* Uses MSE loss on heatmaps with soft-argmax refinement for coordinate accuracy
* Metrics include average corner error in pixels

> Visualizations are saved per epoch showing both ground-truth and predicted corners.

* Web Export

* Loads the `.keras` model with the custom `SoftArgmax` layer
* Converts it into a TFJS `graph_model` for browser inference
* Outputs to a zip archive (`web_model.zip`)

> The model can be used on the web for ROI card extraction with tfjs.
