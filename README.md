## Project Overview

This repository covers the full pipeline for:

1. Generating synthetic training data from real MTG card art
2. Training a keypoint regression model using heatmaps + soft-argmax
3. Exporting a compact TensorFlow\.js model for web/mobile inference

---

## 1. Synthetic Dataset Generation

* Sources card images from the Scryfall API (black, white, and borderless frame parity enforced)
* Applies controlled perspective, affine, and rotation transforms
* Cards are composited over randomized photographic or textured backgrounds
* Annotations include the 4 corner coordinates in 1024Ã—1024 pixel space

**Output example:**

```json
{
  "filename": "00042_Llanowar_Elves.jpg",
  "card_name": "Llanowar Elves",
  "corners": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
}
```

All assets are procedurally generated and can be reproduced or extended with additional transformation rules or art sources.

## 2. Model Training

### Workflow

* Backbone: `MobileNetV2` (pretrained, lightweight)
* Output: 4-channel heatmap (56Ã—56) + decoded corner coordinates
* Decoder: Differentiable soft-argmax (implemented as a Keras layer)
* Loss: MSE over heatmaps only (coordinate output is derived, not directly supervised)
* Training: \~35 epochs on Kaggle P100; early stopping and simplified callbacks

### Differences from Previous Workflow for mobile target:

| Aspect             | Old Workflow                               | New Workflow                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Backbone           | ResNet50 with multi-scale skip connections | MobileNetV2 (single-output, smaller model)   |
| Heatmap resolution | 112Ã—112                                    | 56Ã—56                                        |
| Sigma              | 2.0 (broader peaks)                        | 1.5 (sharper localization)                   |
| Loss config        | Combined loss with heatmap + coordinates   | Only heatmap loss (coordinates inferred)     |
| Callbacks          | TQDM, ReduceLROnPlateau, visual debugger   | EarlyStopping only                           |
| Export flow        | `.keras` â†’ SavedModel â†’ TFJS               | Direct `.keras` export with `model.export()` |
| TFJS compatibility | Manual wrapping of soft-argmax for export  | Fully WASM-compatible model at export time   |

---

## 3. Web Deployment

* Model exported as a TFJS graph model using `tensorflowjs_converter`
* Target format: `tfjs_graph_model` (WASM-safe)
* Export directory is zipped as `web_model.zip` for use in the frontend
* Optimized for use with `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm` or `webgl` runtime backends
